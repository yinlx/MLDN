def avg_medal_count_1():
    '''
    Compute the average number of bronze medals earned by countries who
    earned at least one gold medal.

    Save this to a variable named avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold. You do not
    need to call the function in your code when running it in the browser -
    the grader will do that automatically when you submit or test it.

    HINT-1:
    You can retrieve all of the values of a Pandas column from a
    data frame, "df", as follows:
    df['column_name']

    HINT-2:
    The numpy.mean function can accept as an argument a single
    Pandas column.

    For example, numpy.mean(df["col_name"]) would return the
    mean of the values located in "col_name" of a dataframe df.
